# Sea Level Predictor

This project aims to predict future sea levels based on historical data. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze trends and patterns in sea level changes over time to predict the sea level change through year 2050.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   `data/`: Contains the historical sea level data.
*   `src/`: Python source code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DaniElias7/sea_level_predictor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the code:**
    Execute the Python scripts in the `src/` directory to generate the prediction.

## Dependencies

*   Python 3.x
*   NumPy
*   Pandas
*   Scikit-learn
